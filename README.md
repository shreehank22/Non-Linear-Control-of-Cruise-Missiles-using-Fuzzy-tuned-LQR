#  Non-Linear Control of Cruise Missiles using Fuzzy-Tuned LQR

This repository presents a **fuzzy logic-based intelligent control strategy** to enhance the performance of a **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)** for a cruise missile system modeled using **feedback linearization**. By integrating a fuzzy inference system to adaptively tune LQR parameters, the controller demonstrates superior robustness to disturbances and achieves a **28.92% improvement in tracking performance**.

##  Methodology

1. **System Modeling:**

   * Nonlinear dynamics of a cruise missile are modeled and linearized using **feedback linearization**.

2. **Conventional LQR:**

   * Baseline control designed using standard LQR with fixed $Q$ and $R$ matrices.

3. **Fuzzy-Tuned LQR:**

   * Developed a **FIS (FLC\_Final1.fis)** to dynamically adjust the LQR weights based on system error and state feedback.
   * Improved adaptability and transient response under varying conditions.

4. **Simulation & Validation:**

   * Compared fuzzy-tuned LQR and conventional LQR in Simulink (`Final_PAPER2_wtdelay_fuzzy.slx` and `Final_PAPER2_wtdelay_LQR.slx`).
   * Assessed improvements in tracking error, control effort, and system stability.
